threefive continued.  SCTE-35 for the People.
# Now with Super Advanced Error Detection and Stuff. 
* Does not generate Fatal errors, it won't break your process.
* Displays what is in error and how to correct it.
* Works in the cli
* Works in code.

# Issues and Bugs.
* If there is a bug in threefive3, please do report it and if it's valid, I will fix it.
* If you think you have a bug, I need you to prove it. I need the entire error message, the code you're running, and the SCTE-35.
---
# Special Requests 
* __I am not here to teach you SCTE-35__.[ 
* __If need some work done, this is what I do for a living, you can hire me.__
* SCTE-35 is not intuitive. What will take you several months to figure out, will only take me a few hours to do.
* If you want to discuss your project open an issue and I'll send you my contact info.
---

# `Install`
* python3 via pip

git clone https://github.com/superkabuki/scte35.git
cd scte35
make install
```

# `The Cli tool`
> The cli audetects data being available on stdin and that allows it to autodetect the SCTE-35 format as well as MPEGTS steams. Now every SCTE-35 data format, except hls, is autodetected on the commandline, as well as stdin.HLS requires the `hls` ketyword.

### The cli tool installs automatically with pip or the Makefile.

* [__SCTE-35 Inputs__](#inputs)
* [__SCTE-35 Outputs__](#outputs)
* [__Parse __MPEGTS__ streams for __SCTE-35__](#streams)
* [Parse __SCTE-35__ in __hls__](#hls)
* [Display __MPEGTS__ __iframes__](#iframes)
* [Display raw __SCTE-35 packets__ from __video streams__](#packets)
* [__Repair SCTE-35 streams__ changed to __bin data__ by __ffmpeg__](#sixfix)


### `Inputs` 
* the cli can __decode SCTE-35__ from
 * [__Base64__](#base64)
 * [__Hex,__](#hex)
 * [__HLS,__](#hls)
 * [__JSON,__](#json)
 * [__Xml,__](#xml)
 * [__Xml+Bin__](#xmlbin)
 * [__MPEGTS Streams__](#streams)

* Most __inputs__ are __auto-detected.__ 
* __stdin__ is __auto selected__ and __auto detected.__
* __SCTE-35 data is printed to stderr__
* __stdout is used when piping video__
#### `Base64` 
* parse SCTE-35 encoded in Base64
```rebol
threefive3 '/DAsAAAAAyiYAP/wCgUAAAABf1+ZmQEBABECD0NVRUkAAAAAf4ABADUAAC2XQZU='
```

#### `Hex`
* parse SCTE-35 encoded in Hex
```rebol
threefive3 0xfc302c00000003289800fff00a05000000017f5f999901010011020f43554549000000007f8001003500002d974195
```

#### `HLS`

* parse SCTE-35 from HLS manifests and segments
```rebol
threefive3 hls https://example.com/master.m3u8
```

#### `Json`

```rebol
cat json.json | threefive3
```
#### `Xml`
* you can make a xml.xml file like this:
  * redirect 2 (stderr) to the file 
```awk
./threefive3  '/DAsAAAAAyiYAP/wCgUAAAABf1+ZmQEBABECD0NVRUkAAAAAf4ABADUAAC2XQZU=' xml 2> xml.xml
```
* pass in
```rebol
threefive3  < xml.xml
```
#### `Xmlbin`

```rebol
threefive3 < xmlbin.xml
```
___
### `Outputs`

 * the cli can __encode SCTE-35__ to
 * [__Base64__](#base64-1)
 * [__Bytes__](#bytes)
 * [__Hex,__](#hex-1)
 * [__HLS,__](#hls-1)
 * [__JSON,__](#json-1)
 * [__Xml,__](#xml-1)
 * [__Xml+Bin__](#xmlbin-1)

* default output is `json`

#### json
